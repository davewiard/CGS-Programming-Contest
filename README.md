# CGS-Programming-Contest

The [Catlin Gabel School Programming Contest](https://teamscode.com/contests/spring-cgs-programming-contest/)
was held on April 7, 2018 at the Catlin Gabel School in Beaverton, OR. The
contest was comprised of eleven teams ranging from intermediate to advanced
level. Each team was given one sample problem as a warm-up to solve before the
main contest began. After the sample problem was solved, each team was given a
set of fifteen problems and given three hours to solve as many as possible.

## Problems ##

Each problem had a single text input file with associated output. Once the
team was confident their program generated the proper results they submitted
their program for judgment. The judges brought a thumb drive with a different
input file that generated different results.

## Scoring ##

Each problem that was solved was given points based on the number of attempts
it took to get the correct solution. If the problem was solved correctly on the
first submission 50 points were given. Each incorrect submission incurred a
5-point penalty. If the problem was solved correctly on the second submission
the team was given 45 points, 40 points if solved correctly on the third
submission, and so on.

## Winning ##

The team with the most points at the end of the three hour contest was the
winner. If two teams both ended the contest with the same number of points the
team who solved their final problem earliest was the winner.
